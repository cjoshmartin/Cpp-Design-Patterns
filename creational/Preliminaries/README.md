**S**ingle Responsibility Prinicple (SRP)
   - A class should only have a single responsibility
   
**O**pen-Closed Principle (OCP)
   - open for extension but closed for modification
   
**L**iskov Substitution PRrinciple (LSP)
   - Objects should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering program correctness
   
**I**nterface Segregation Principle (ISP)
   - Many client-specific interfaces better than one general-purpose interface
   
**D**ependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
   - Dependencies should be abstract rather then concrete
